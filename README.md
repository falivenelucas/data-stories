# About me
Hi! I am Lucas Falivene, a student in the Telling stories with data class.<br>
Currently a second-year student of the ISPM program (information security!) at Heinz College. I am also a Fulbright scholar from Argentina. <br>
My major in undergrad was Business and Information Ssytems.<br>
Regarding my future plans, I am planning to apply for a PhD program once I finish my master. I will be finishing my master by May next year! <br>
Pronouns: he/him 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to easily comunicate the trends and facts shown by data in a clear and effective way.<br>
I will focus on getting a good understunding of the methods and tools that could help in creating an appealing story with data <br>
It is hard to understund the story behind the data but I think it is even harder to deliver that story.<br>
Getting some tips on this will be extremely useful for anytype of future work or research.

### Assignment1: Visualizing government debt 

In this section you can find the visualizations related to the government debt assignment.<br>
All data was extracted from the public OECD's website. The OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an "an international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives" according to their about me section of their website.<br>

### Government debt bar chart 

Within the following visualization we can analyze the debt to GDP ratio for each country in 2016. <br>
Following visualizations will depth in years data available.

### Government debt Grid of line charts

Within the following visualization we can analyze the development of the debt to GDP ratio for each country under analysis. The scope of the data ranges between 1995 and 2016.<br> <br>
The difference with the preovious visualization is that we can see now the evolution of the ratio across multiple years (rather than a single spot in time with the previous chart).

### Government debt third data visualization

The following visualization  allows us to analyze each contry individually helping to focus the atention of the user that seeks to compare a few countries.It shows the the development of the debt to GDP ratio for each selected country under analysis. <br><br>
The choice was primarily set to decrease the high amount of information the previous visualization comunicated.
The main difference is that we now constinue to show the  development of the debt to GDP ratio for countries during the same time frame, but one at a time. Easing the analysis and interpretation of results. 
This visulization eases the noise of too much data and allows the user to easily compare different countries ratio evolution.<br><br>
My intention was to create a viualization that allows the user to select multiple countriwes at a time. For that I tried have to radically change the dataset. However, I failed to find a non time-consuming solution.<br>

# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

###  Original data visualization

![alt text](https://github.com/falivenelucas/data-stories/blob/master/InSource-Cybersecurity-Graphic-for-Blog-Post-July-2017.png?raw=true)

Source: https://insourcenow.com/insights/cyber-security-staffing-for-businesses/ (Extracted 9-23-2020)

I am passionate about cybersecurity, so I wanted to start working with some data visualizations related to that field. I choose precisely this visualization because the usual statistic regarding security is the number of data breaches. The graph tries to deliver that message, telling the story about the impact of data breaches and their various types. This is important to know for any security professional, organizations, or public policy professional. We can not manage security adequately if we do not understand what is happening and our significant problems.

###  Process

I design three alternatives of improvement for the original visualization; each one highlighting a different perspective of the data story. The reviewers then will comment and choose the one they like the most and provide some recommendations for improvement.

###  Alternative A

###  Alternative B

###  Alternative C

###  Reviwer 1

1) It´s an analysis of the evolution and trends of the different types of cyberattacks over the last decade. Providing three different visualizations that show the information in distinct ways.<br><br>
2) It is telling me that hacking attack types are growing exponentially while the other types are decreasing in occurrence.<br><br>
3) In the first graph the data point in the hacking dimension from 2016, is represented by a dot that is much bigger than the rest, which doesn´t make any sense and confuses the analysis. In the second graph, only the hacking type is given a percentage metric, while the others are blank and it is very hard to understand the percentage of attacks that are attributed to them. Finally, in the third graph, there is no title, so it makes the viewer unaware of what is being displayed.<br><br>
4) The intended audiences are businesses and professionals, such as IT and Cybersecurity experts that have an interest in gaining insights and knowledge about the cyberattack's background that may be useful for them to protect their information.<br><br>
5) First, I would analyze a greater timespan because the graphs only provide 4 years of data and it would be useful to have more data in order to understand the trends better. Secondly, I would fix the confusing aspects I mentioned before. Thirdly, I would provide predictions for the upcoming years and what the trends will be.<br>

###  Reviwer 2

1) This is a diagram that illustrates the number of incidents associated with different types of cyberattacks between 2013 and 2016. <br><br>
2) It demonstrates how hacking was still the main cause for cyber incidents between 2013 and 2016, and how data in transient became more risky than insider theft by 2016.<br><br>
3) It is quite surprising that hacking maintained its status as the highest cause for cyber incidents for 4 consecutive years, and our cybersecurity didn’t improve to minimize the effect of hacking.<br><br>
4) Internet users, IT departments, and C-suite such as: CIO, CTO, and CFO to secure their organizations<br><br>
5) I would try to quantify the number of incidents on the y-axis to better illustrate the risk and impact of these cyber threats. <br>

###  Reviwer 3

1)  Evolution of # of Data breach incidents in 4 years showing important tendencies by type of breach. <br><br>
2) Data breaches caused by hacking techniques are the most common. Besides, the frequency of this type of data breach has an increasing tendency.<br><br>
3) I wonder what happened on 2015 when Inside theft and hacking had similar values. Scale on Y axis would help to get the proportions. br><br>
4) Executives who need to understand the growing importance of Information Security<br><br>
5) Include scale on Y axis. nclude “Others” line br>

###  Final data visualization

I learn a few things about the critiques (readers have trouble understunding some aspects of the graphs and absorbing the story behind the data) and made me do the following changes:
- Update Y-axis and putting numbers to scale.
- 

I know attemp to only show the main story: the main security incident types and their evolution in time.
