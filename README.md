# About me
Hi! I am Lucas Falivene, a student in the Telling stories with data class.<br>
Currently a second-year student of the ISPM program (information security!) at Heinz College. I am also a Fulbright scholar from Argentina. <br>
My major in undergrad was Business and Information Ssytems.<br>
Regarding my future plans, I am planning to apply for a PhD program once I finish my master. I will be finishing my master by May next year! <br>
Pronouns: he/him 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to easily comunicate the trends and facts shown by data in a clear and effective way.<br>
I will focus on getting a good understunding of the methods and tools that could help in creating an appealing story with data <br>
It is hard to understund the story behind the data but I think it is even harder to deliver that story.<br>
Getting some tips on this will be extremely useful for anytype of future work or research.
