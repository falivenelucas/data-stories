All data was extracted from the public OECD's website. The OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an "an international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives" according to their about me section of their website.<br>

Within the following visualization we can analyze the development of the debt to GDP ratio for each country under analysis. The scope of the data ranges between 1995 and 2016.<br> <br>
The difference with the preovious visualization is that we can see now the evolution of the ratio across multiple years (rather than a single spot in time with the previous chart).

### Government debt third data visualization

The following visualization  allows us to analyze each contry individually helping to focus the atention of the user that seeks to compare a few countries.It shows the the development of the debt to GDP ratio for each selected country under analysis. <br><br>
The choice was primarily set to decrease the high amount of information the previous visualization comunicated.
The main difference is that we now constinue to show the  development of the debt to GDP ratio for countries during the same time frame, but one at a time. Easing the analysis and interpretation of results. 
This visulization eases the noise of too much data and allows the user to easily compare different countries ratio evolution.<br><br>
My intention was to create a viualization that allows the user to select multiple countriwes at a time. For that I tried have to radically change the dataset. However, I failed to find a non time-consuming solution.<br>
