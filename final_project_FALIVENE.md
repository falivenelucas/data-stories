This is the final project page for the Telling stories with data course for Lucas Falivene.

# Outline

### Final project Topic

The topic of the project will try to answer the following question: should we even care about passwords?
I am interested in showing the credential stuffing problem, its consequences on users and how can we all try to fight back cybercriminals.

### Background information

"In this digital age, privacy and cybersecurity are interconnected. Persona information is stored in cloud storage, emails, and social networks. Such personal data
can reveal sensitive data about a person’s work experience, sexual orientation, and political opinions. Cyberattacks against corporations such as LinkedIn or normal users on the web can be considered intrusive privacy events. These attacks could eventually disclose sensitive information to the public" (Falivene et al., 2020).

The criminal methodology of credential stuffing "benefits from previous cyberattacks and gathers combinations of personal usernames and passwords. These combinations (known as combolists) are verified via automation tools to attempt to login to services such as social networking and streaming services. Unfortunately, people tend to use the same username and password for certain types of services. For example, there is a high probability that a person has the same username and password for his/her Netflix and Hulu accounts. Credential stuffing aims to identify which services can be accessed using a set of leaked credentials. As a result, such accounts can be sold or even distributed for free by hackers in underground forums or the dark web" (Falivene et al., 2020).

### Setup

Leaked passwords are everywhere. Dark web sites, underground forums, credential stuffing websites, pastebin alike sites and even in social media pages, profiles and groups. There is agrat amount of evidence at plain sight that credential stuffing is a grave problem. However, users still get hacked periodically. Solutions tend to be missing in this area.

The idea in this step is to try to get the audience gasp an idea pf the amount of credentials leaked everyday. The pbject will be to comunicate the dimension of the problem.

### Conflict

The main point of this section will be to make realize the audience that they all use passwords and that they could have been or be potential victims (it is a major generalized trend). Moreover, I will try to focus on the potential consequencies and impacts.

Users tend to reuse passwords which makes credential stuffers' work an easy task. What could happen if we reuse passwords and are victims of credential stuffing? For example, Joe uses the same password for his bank, Netflix, CompanyX and Facebook account. CompanyX lately suffered a majora data breach that exposed more than 256 millon user's emails and passwords, including Joe's credentials. Now, hackers can use this leaked information to "stuff" Joe and acess his Bank, Netflix and Facebook account as the email and password nedded for those platforms are already known to them. 

### Resolution and call to action

What can we do to stop this? The objective here is to give the audience some quick call to actions that can help to fight back this cybercriminal activity.
