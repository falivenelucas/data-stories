# Final project page

This is the final project page for the Telling stories with data course for Lucas Falivene.

# Outline

### Final project Topic

The project’s topic will try to answer the following question: should we even care about passwords?
I am interested in showing the credential stuffing problem, its consequences on users, and how we can all try to fight back cybercriminals.

### Background information

"In this digital age, privacy and cybersecurity are interconnected. Persona information is stored in cloud storage, emails, and social networks. Such personal data
can reveal sensitive data about a person’s work experience, sexual orientation, and political opinions. Cyberattacks against corporations such as LinkedIn or normal users on the web can be considered intrusive privacy events. These attacks could eventually disclose sensitive information to the public" (Falivene et al., 2020).

The criminal methodology of credential stuffing "benefits from previous cyberattacks and gathers combinations of personal usernames and passwords. These combinations (known as combolists) are verified via automation tools to attempt to login to services such as social networking and streaming services. Unfortunately, people tend to use the same username and password for certain types of services. For example, there is a high probability that a person has the same username and password for his/her Netflix and Hulu accounts. Credential stuffing aims to identify which services can be accessed using a set of leaked credentials. As a result, such accounts can be sold or even distributed for free by hackers in underground forums or the dark web" (Falivene et al., 2020).

### Setup

Leaked passwords are everywhere. Dark web sites, underground forums, credential stuffing websites, Pastebin alike sites, and even social media pages, profiles, and groups. There is a tremendous amount of evidence at plain sight that credential stuffing is a grave problem. However, users still get hacked periodically. Solutions tend to be missing in this area.

The idea in this step is to try to get the audience to grasp an idea of the number of credentials leaked every day. The project will be to communicate the dimension of the problem.

### Conflict

This section’s main point will be to make the audience realize that they all use passwords and that they could have been or been potential victims (it is a major generalized trend). Moreover, I will try to focus on the possible consequences and impacts.

Users tend to reuse passwords, which make credential stuffers' work an easy task. What could happen if we reuse passwords and are victims of credential stuffing? For example, Joe uses the same password for his bank, Netflix, CompanyX, and Facebook account. CompanyX lately suffered a significant data breach that exposed more than 256 million users’ emails and passwords, including Joe's credentials. Now, hackers can use this leaked information to "stuff" Joe and access his Bank, Netflix, and Facebook account as the email and password needed for those platforms are already known to them. 

### Resolution and call to action

What can we do to stop this? The objective here is to give the audience some quick call to actions that can help to fight back this cybercriminal activity.

# The data

As there is no agency or organization that, with all the data related to the problem under analysis, I will use various reliable sources to aggregate the different perspectives over the issue. Some of the sources under examination will be:

- Surveys results from pewresearch.org <br>
https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/
https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/


- Data form various cybersecurity firms <br>

- Statista <br>
https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/


- Own generated data <br>
I will try to add data from an ongoing research project from another course. However, this will be subjected to IRB approval. The final project delivery does not exclusively depend on this data but can rather be beneficial to it.

# Method and medium

I will use Shorthand to present all the materials for the final project. I will use various tools to create the visualizations that I will later add to Shorthand.
The first phase will be the discovery, that it is almost done - as I have already identified the sources of data and what draft visualizations I can create. The second step will be to start playing around with the visualizations and getting reviews about them to improve them. Lastly, all materials will be centralized in Shorthand, and the story will be developed with that platform.

### User Research Protocol
I hope to first find if the reviewers understand the main story behind my visualizations. I will try to target a general audience that does not have any information security background to make sure the story is understandable by any person. I will contact friends that I know are general user internets without a clear specialization on security. Moreover, just for the sake of having a control review I will contact one known reviewer with security expertise. The following are the questions I sent to the reviewers:

1) Can you tell me what you think this is?  <br>
2) Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  <br>
3) Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?  <br>
4)  How do you fell after seeing this? It makes you wonder of think something?  <br>
5) Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  <br>
6)  Is there anything you would change or do differently? Did you find something difficult to understand or that may be difficult for others to understand?

### Reviewers answers

#### Reviewer 1
Age: 20s - Gender: Male - Security expertise: NO

-	It´s an analysis of the cyberattack landscape, showing up statistics and trends about data breaches and people´s attitudes towards their information security. It provides different visualizations that show the information in distinct ways and transmit insights about today´s cybersecurity risks.
-	One thing that surprised me is that only 30% of people are not using a password manager, that´s a very low number and a good indicator. And the one thing I found confusing is certain graphs that lack a Y-axis and numbers, which prevent me from analyzing the graphs in a quantitative way and understand more clearly the trends.
-	I feel more vulnerable, more conscious of the cybersecurity risks I could be exposed to.
-	Everyone, especially those who don´t have much knowledge on the subject.
-	I would include a Y-axis and metrics in certain graphics that don´t have them, such as the number of breaches over time graph and the number of breaches by age. Everything is very clear and transmits knowledge in a very simple and direct way, making it easy for everyone to understand it.

#### Reviewer 2
Age: 30s - Gender: Male - Security expertise: NO

-	This is showing the problem that privacy has with password management.
-	First part is about data breaches in general, but it is trying to support the specific password problem. Data collected, accessed and exposed are not only passwords.
-	Differential approaches based on age would be useful for policy and control developments.
-	Policymakers
-	I would focus more on password leakages rather than mixing general breaches with password breaches.

#### Reviewer 3
Age: 20s - Gender: Female - Security expertise: NO

- It tells me although the majority of people say they care about their passwords, they don't trust the companies to which they give this information. In addition, 70% of them suffer data breaches but this didn't cause a reduction in the reuse of  passwords, or an increase in password strength; the same happens with the rate of
password change. Moreover, more than half of those 70% never checked if they were victims and don't know how to solve it. Furthermore, it is later shown that, 
contrary to popular belief, age is not relevant to this problem. People seem to value being in control of who can get information about oneself
and that most of them do not trust that companies would notify them should their data be compromised It is also shown that data breaches and exposed. Also, that only 30% DON'T use a password manager
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? No
- How do you fell after seeing this? It makes you wonder of think something? actually it makes me wonder why people say they care about privacy, but their actions tell us otherwise, is it because it is to much work? ... probably
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this? it could be anyone, i mean it certainly would be better if everyone knows this, but those who design software security should have special care with this data as it can give the key ideas to come up with a new way of doing things in which  user negligence wouldn't be in the equation.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently? Did you find something difficult to understand or that may be difficult for others to understand?
yes are the two pie charts after 7 out of 10 suffer a data breach out of the 70% or the one of those who don't know how to solve it is from those who did check if they were victims? I think it could be specified better


#### Reviewer 4
Age: 30s - Gender: Male - Security expertise: YES

-	This story is trying to understand people’s perception of privacy in comparison to their behavior (known as privacy paradox).
-	The surprising matter in this story is the high percentage of participants who don’t know how to act if they have a data breach. Also, it is quite alarming that 64% use weak passwords.
-	After seeing this story, I feel that people’s attitude towards data privacy must be corrected. Also, I believe that all websites will need to enforce a strong password policy by default.
-	General public, people interested in privacy and information security.
-	I might delete the age demographics as it doesn’t give a clear indication if it’s an age problem, no clear correlation about age and the bar values. Perhaps if the bar values had a legend describing what it is, it would’ve been a clearer figure.

### highlights and changes: what I learned form the feedback

-	I decided to remove the age demographics visualization as it is indeed confusing, does not gives that much information of the issue and will take time off from the essential during the final presentation.
-	I make all the descriptions shorter and visualizations bigger to ease comprehension and lower the level of expertise the audience need to understand the story.
-	I decided to change some of the visualizations given the reviewers feedback to be similar to others that I included before to again ease the understanding of the audience.

### Final data visualizations

### Call to action

1) Do not reuse passwords <br>
2) Use a password Manager  <br>
3) Sign up for alerts (in less than 15 seconds!) - Here I will reference the audience to the platform: https://haveibeenpwned.com/  <br>

# Part III
### Intended audience
The story targets general users of internet and computers. The idea is not to communicate any technical knowledge whatsoever but try to convey a general security problem that affects any user on the internet. For the latter, I try getting some reviewers without security or technology knowledge - to gauge if they could comprehend the story - and some security-oriented reviewers- to gauge how complex they tough the story was.
In order to make all of this work, I only concentrate on the main topic: why are passwords necessary? And how can we manage them securely and effectively? Avoiding other tangent topics, subjects or technical argon is a must in order to convey the story in just 2 minutes.

### Work summary
I started searching and researching about the topic for another course project some weeks ago. As I thought it was interesting enough to develop some data visualizations to show the magnitude and scope of the issue, I selected it to be the topic for the final project.
Design decision focus on trying to communicate the magnitude of the problem to the audience. How many data breaches there are, how they impact the common user and how common users usually behave to this. It is there some behavior that can be changed to solve this generally spread issue? How do users use passwords? How do they manage them? Is this working?
After some reviews I noticed that I was missing on the story some impact of the issue that could move the audience to act. Without this, the introduction and the call to action were missing a connection. I learned to also include the impact that the audience could relate more in order to tell them that they could also be affected.
The introduction will set the current environment of the “credential stuffing” world, then some consequences and impacts on users will make the way towards the call to action.
