The scope of the data ranges between 1995 and 2016.</br>
The difference with the preovious visualization is that we can see now the evolution of the ratio across multiple years (rather than a single spot in time with the previous chart).

# Government debt third data visualization

The following visualization  allows us to analyze each contry individually helping to focus the atention of the user that seeks to compare a few countries. </br>
It shows the the development of the debt to GDP ratio for each selected country under analysis. </br>
The choice was primarily set to decrease the high amount of information the previous visualization comunicated.</br>
The main difference is that we now constinue to show the  development of the debt to GDP ratio for countries during the same time frame, but one at a time. Easing the analysis and interpretation of results. </br>
This visulization eases the noise of too much data and allows the user to easily compare different countries ratio evolution.</br>
My intention was to create a viualization that allows the user to select multiple countriwes at a time. For that I tried have to radically change the dataset. </br>
However, I failed to find a non time-consuming solution.</br>
